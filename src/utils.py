utils.py

This module provides utility functions for the chunky-monkey project, including:

- Hashing: Functions to generate hashes for article content to detect changes (deltas).
- Logging: Centralized logging setup for consistent log output across modules.
- Environment Variable Loading: Securely loads and validates required environment variables from .env files.

These utilities are designed to be imported and used by other modules in the project to ensure modularity and code reuse.
